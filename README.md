## ðŸ”— Resources

- **Designs:** You will need to use this [Figma file](https://www.figma.com/design/YuEMNteoQic0h6RRiYprpV/Countries-API-Project?m=auto&t=C9b6FsfUdPspzaqu-1) for the designs
- **API:** You will use the [REST Countries API](https://restcountries.com) to get the country data and flag images
- **Documentation Guides:** The teaching team at AnnieCannons has provided some [handy guides](https://docs.google.com/document/d/18jxCUA0bebCyYaIHy8aaKMgOQH4w5-b-iCGDWpV4K4M/edit?tab=t.0#heading=h.ykdbmvmlp0ag) to help you use Github and other coding tools

## ðŸš€ The Roadmap

You will build multiple iterations of this project, where each version lives in a separate folder in the project repo. 

You'll start out by building Version 0, which is just the Frontend UI of the Home page. 

You'll end the course having built Version 5, which is a full-stack web application where you have built every layer yourself: the frontend with React, the API with Express and Node.js, and the database with PostgreSQL. 

| Version | Feature added | Where data is stored | 
| ------- | ---------- | ---- |
| 0 | Frontend UI - Home page | No data stored. |
| 1 | Frontend UI - Home page, SavedCountries page, CountryDetail page| No data stored. |
| 2 | Local Storage | Data is stored locally in the browser with Local Storage. |
| 3 | Fetch API | Data is stored remotely in a backend provided by the instructor. I have no control over the backend, but I can store and retrieve data from the frontend using HTTP requests. |
| 4 | Local Postgres Database with API layer + Node.js | Data is stored in a local database, and I am responsible for how it is called and received (or placed) in the database. I control and have built all aspects of the data communication and the data storage in the database. |
| 5 | Remote Postgres Database with API layer + Node.js | I have deployed my database to a remote server! |
